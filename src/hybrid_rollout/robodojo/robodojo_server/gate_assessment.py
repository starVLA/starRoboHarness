GATE_INSTRUCTION = """Use the environment's task instruction as the objective.
Derive ordered subgoals and prerequisites from that instruction; do not assume
any particular object, destination or task family. Maintain task_progress:
verified_completed (list), currently_attempting (string), remaining (list).
Update completion only from visual execution evidence; undo a completed
subgoal if later observations show it has been lost (e.g. a structure collapses).
Keep the original task instruction as the student's input.
At each chunk boundary, assess two separate questions:
1. What happened during the LAST executed chunk? Compare before/after RGB,
   measured robot state, executed gripper commands and same-episode history.
   A closed command alone proves neither grasp success nor failure. Look for
   object motion during lifting, slipping, missed placement or sustained lack
   of progress. Distinguish pending/uncertain results from an observed failure.
2. Given the current task phase, does the NEXT student chunk pursue an
   appropriate subgoal? Infer intent from its robot-only FK trajectory and
   gripper sequence; do not claim access to the student's internal intention.
   Advancing to a dependent subgoal after its prerequisite failed is wrong.
   Also check selected object, destination, required order and grasp/release phase.
   Realigning for a retry can be appropriate: allow student self-recovery.
Return a concise assessment with task_progress, current_subgoal, execution_status,
execution_evidence, expected_next_intent, predicted_next_intent, intent_status,
and intent_evidence. Statuses: execution not_started/progressing/failed/
uncertain/recovered; intent aligned/misaligned/uncertain.
An edit/eef takeover requires execution_status=failed or intent_status=misaligned.
Uncertainty alone or an aesthetically imperfect pose is not a takeover reason.
After recovery, hand back when the current state and student subgoal are suitable.
Do not rewind. Do not use object truth, reward or future simulated object states.
